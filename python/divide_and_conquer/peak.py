Question: Finding the Peak of a Unimodal Array

Problem Statement: You are given a unimodal array A of integers, where the elements first increase to a peak at index p, and then decrease. Your task is to find the index of the peak element using a divide-and-conquer approach. The algorithm should run in O(logn) time.

    Find the index of the peak element in a unimodal array.

    A unimodal array is defined as an array that first increases to a maximum 
    value (the peak) and then decreases. This function uses a divide-and-conquer 
    approach to efficiently find the peak index in O(log n) time.
    
    Args:
        lst (List[int]): A list of integers representing the unimodal array. The list must have at least one element, and all elements must be distinct.
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of the peak element in the array. 
                         
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty or contains duplicate elements.
